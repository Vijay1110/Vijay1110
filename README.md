### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Vijay.Heeralal.Yadav, a software developer (he/him) from India. I currently work in Pune IN, building web and mobile apps :-) My main stack is currently React, Angular,React Native, Node (including NestJS) .

Web Tech, Software testing has been one of my favourite tech topics for a while! I'm looking forward to learning more about the current tools and libraries (React, Golang, Cypress, react-testing-library, Jest, Jasmine) and hopefully contributing to them.

Besides tech stuff, I really enjoy nomadic lifestyle.
